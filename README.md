# Housing-prices-prediction-GUI

This machine learning project helps you to get a better understanding on training a regression model but of course creating a machine learning model is not enough. You should use that model to create something more useful for the humankind. In this project i tried to apply my trained model into Tkinter GUI. I Hope you will find this project helpful.

<h3> Importing Libraries</h3>
Needed libraries and methods are imported into the IDE.

<h3> Exploration of Dataset</h3>

Imported dataset is examined in this part and the correlation between variables are shown.

<h3> Model Training</h3>

Random Forest Regression model is used but before begining to training the model first dataset is split into two subsets.


<h3> Model Accuracy</h3>

Model was trained and accuracy values of the model is checked. R2 score value is 0.75 but this project is about using a model in a GUI. Therefore, any model validation was not applied to the model.

<h3> Creation of GUI Using Tkinter</h3>

Under this headline GUI is formed and a prediction value from previously trained model is obtained by using entry values of GUI.
